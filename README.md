## Project Overview

The Titanic dataset offers details on passengers, and this project aims to predict survival outcomes based on these features. This involves analyzing data, engineering new features, and training various machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and includes features like:
- *Pclass*: Ticket class
- *Sex*: Gender
- *Age*: Age of the passenger
- *Fare*: Ticket fare
- *SibSp*: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
- *Parch*: Number of parents or children aboard

## Installation and Setup
